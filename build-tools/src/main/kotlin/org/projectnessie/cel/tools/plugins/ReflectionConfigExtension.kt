/** Configuration that specifies which classes shall be mentioned in generated

 * implemented interfaces matches one of the regex patterns in `classImplementsPatterns`.
 *
 * By default the plugin scans the classes by the project's source-sets "main" + "test".
 * It can optionally consider resolvable configurations specified in `includeConfigurations`.
 *
 * Note that the plugin scans the classes using "asm" and does not consider any indirect
 * superclass nor does it consider any implicitly implementated interface.
